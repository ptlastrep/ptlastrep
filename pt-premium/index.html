                    I have been working with Dan for 12 weeks now. I have gone from hating exercise and finding it a chore to enjoying it and looking forward to sessions with him and the ones I do myself from his Online Coaching app which is great. He has changed my mindset completely. I am calorie counting and gymming 4 times a week. I am a stone down and my body shape has changed massively already. I can’t wait to keep training with him and see what next year brings. If you are looking for someone to help you reach your goals, Dan is the man!

                            He knows his stuff inside out and I’m really enjoying hearing about the science and theory behind the workouts - which he is clearly passionate about!
